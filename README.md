# Text Classification Project with BERT

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at developing a text classification system using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. BERT is a pre-trained transformer model known for its superior performance in natural language processing tasks. The objective of this project is to classify text data into predefined categories accurately.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Importing Libraries

The project begins by importing the essential libraries needed for data processing, model handling, and evaluation. Key libraries include:

- **Datasets and Transformers**: For managing datasets and utilizing pre-trained models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Torch**: For tensor operations and GPU support.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and metrics.

### 2. Loading Data

Data is loaded from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames. This step involves reading the training and test datasets, which contain text and associated labels.

### 3. Encoding Labels

To make the text labels understandable for the model, they are converted into numerical values. This step involves mapping each unique label to an integer.

### 4. Preparing Datasets

The data is then transformed into Hugging Face `Dataset` objects. This conversion simplifies the integration with the `transformers` library, facilitating easier handling and processing of the data.

### 5. Tokenization

The text data is processed using a tokenizer from the pre-trained BERT model. Tokenization converts text into a format that BERT can interpret. This process includes padding and truncating the text to ensure it fits within the model's input size constraints.

### 6. Extracting Hidden States

Hidden states, which are the internal representations learned by BERT, are extracted. These hidden states serve as features for training the classification model. The extraction process involves passing the tokenized text through BERT to obtain these representations.

### 7. Training the Model

With the extracted features, a classification model is trained. This model leverages the representations from BERT to classify text into predefined categories. The training process involves fine-tuning the model on the labeled training data.

### 8. Evaluating the Model

Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy and F1 score. This step involves applying the model to the test dataset and comparing its predictions with the actual labels.

## Conclusion

This text classification project demonstrates how BERT can be utilized for classifying text data with high accuracy. By leveraging pre-trained models and sophisticated tokenization techniques, the project effectively transforms raw text into actionable insights.

## Future Work

Potential improvements for this project include exploring other pre-trained models, experimenting with different hyperparameters, and incorporating additional data for better performance.
